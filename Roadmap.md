# ROADMAP
The roadmap is very basic as it is indeed a really small project. 
Each improvement is listed in its own area:
* Firestore -> regarding better management of the firestore aspect
* FrontEnd -> regarding React web app
* Firebase functions -> regarding firebase functions

## FIRESTORE
- add admin page to remove accounts

## FRONTEND
- completely revisit error management in all pages
- add my own alert popup (stop using alerts)

## FIREBASE FUNCTIONS
- Add error management for all different scenarios in the bookking app
- Do not close the chromium driver each and every booking
